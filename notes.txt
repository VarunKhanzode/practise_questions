asyncio-
Use Case: 
    I/O-bound tasks where you spend time waiting for external resources (e.g., file I/O, network requests, database queries).

How it works: 
    asyncio uses asynchronous programming to handle multiple I/O-bound tasks concurrently within a single thread. 
    Tasks release control during wait times, allowing other tasks to execute.


multithreading-
Use Case: 
    I/O-bound tasks that need low-latency or interaction with libraries that don't support asyncio.

How it works:
    Multiple threads share the same memory space. 
    The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, 
    so this isn't effective for CPU-bound tasks.

multiprocessing-
Use Case: 
    CPU-bound tasks that require parallel execution across multiple CPU cores.

How it works: 
    Spawns separate processes, each with its own memory space. This bypasses the GIL, making it suitable for CPU-heavy tasks.
